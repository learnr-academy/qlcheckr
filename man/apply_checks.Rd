\title{Apply Code Checks for Quarto Live with Feedback and Debugging}
\usage{
apply_checks(
  ...,
  .msg_correct = "That's correct! Well done.",
  .msg_incorrect = "That's incorrect! Please try again...",
  .debug = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Named logical expressions representing the tests to be evaluated.
Each test's name should provide a hint or message to display when the test fails.
A test passes if it evaluates to \code{FALSE} and fails if it evaluates to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{.msg_correct}{Character. The message to display when all tests pass.
Default is \code{"That's correct! Well done."}.}

\item{.msg_incorrect}{Character. The message to display when any test fails.
Default is \code{"That's incorrect! Please try again..."}.}

\item{.debug}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints detailed debug information, including
the state of all tests and additional internal evaluation details. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{.msg_correct} if all tests pass (\code{FALSE}), or \code{.msg_incorrect}
followed by the failure hints for tests that failed (\code{TRUE}).
When \code{.debug} is \code{TRUE}, additional debug information is printed.
}
\description{
This function evaluates user code against a series of named tests, providing
feedback based on the test outcomes. It integrates with Quarto Live to
facilitate interactive code checking.

\examples{
# Example usage:
apply_checks(
  "Your math doesn't work correctly." = 1 + 1 != 2,
  "Your logic is flawed." = 3 * 3 != 9
)
# Returns: "That's correct! Well done."

apply_checks(
  "Your math doesn't work correctly." = 1 + 1 != 2,
  "Your logic is flawed." = 3 * 3 != 8
)
# Returns:
# "That's incorrect! Please try again...
# - Your logic is flawed."

apply_checks(
  "Your math doesn't work correctly." = 1 + 1 != 2,
  .debug = TRUE
)
# Debug output includes detailed evaluation results and failure messages.
